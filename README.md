# PD-DGD

The datasets we used to train the DA tagger:
1. For Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/swb1_dialogact_annot.tar.gz
2. For Maptask http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/maptask/
3. For AMI: http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/
4. For Dailydialog: http://yanran.li/dailydialog

The code to process the DA data: https://github.com/ColingPaper2018/DialogueAct-Tagger
Please cite their paper "ISO-Standard Domain-Independent Dialogue Act Tagging for Conversational Agents" if you use their code.

The datasets we used in the paper:
1. Wiard of Wikipedia: "WIZARD OF WIKIPEDIA: KNOWLEDGE-POWERED CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS"
2. Holl-E: "Towards exploiting background knowledge for building conversation systems"
3. Doc2dial: "doc2dial: A Goal-Oriented Document-Grounded Dialogue Dataset"

We will upload the rest related code and data for the PD-DGD paper in the coming weeks.
